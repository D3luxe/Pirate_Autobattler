## üîß New: Item Object Model & Tooltip Enforcement
- All item effects must support rarity-based definitions. Ability/action parameters (damage, heal, cooldown, shield, etc.) must be tunable per tier (Bronze/Silver/Gold/Diamond). Merging into a higher rarity must always replace effect values with the new tier‚Äôs parameters.

- All items must conform to a unified schema: Identity (id, name, rarity, tags, size), Economy (baseCost, sellValue), Abilities (trigger + actions + priority + type), State (cooldownRemaining, stacks, disabled, vars), and Enchantments.  
- Items must always be the same object across contexts (shop, reward, inventory, battle).  
- Tooltips must always render from the item schema, never hardcoded text.  
- Tooltip sections must include: Header (name, rarity, tags), Context Row (cost/sell/cooldown), Abilities (resolved from triggers/actions), Enchantments, Live State (cooldowns, stacks, disabled status), and Merge Preview if applicable.  
- Tooltip numbers must resolve live values (e.g., cooldown remaining, currentDamage, stack counts) from the item state.  
- Stackable effects must display both count and tick interval (e.g., Burn √ó3, triggers every 5 ticks).  
- Boolean effects must display remaining duration only (e.g., Stunned: 3s).  
- Passives must display their trigger conditions (e.g., ‚ÄúWhen ally activates‚Ä¶‚Äù).  
- Merge preview must always show the resulting upgrade path (e.g., ‚ÄúBronze + Bronze ‚áí Silver‚Äù).  


## üõ° Enemy Design Enforcement
- Enemies must be authored as fixed templates (no runtime stat scaling).  
- Depth progression must control which enemies appear, not their stats.  
- Same enemy cannot appear in consecutive battles.  
- One-per-run enemies must not reappear within the same run.  
- Telemetry/QA must validate enemy pool composition, back-to-back ban, and one-per-run logic.
