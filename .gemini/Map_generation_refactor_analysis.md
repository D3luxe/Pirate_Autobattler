 Key Progress:
   * Fixed rows, row bans, elite unlocking, weighted typing with re-rolls, and Unknown node resolution with pity are largely implemented.
   * Basic RulesSO additions and graph metadata are present.

  Critical Gaps & Next Steps:
   1. Re-roll Validation (Phase 2): The re-roll loop in AssignNodeTypesWeighted lacks full validation, which is a major source of persistent map generation errors. This is the highest priority.
   2. Per-Row-Band Generation Odds (Phase 0): GenerationOdds is currently global; implementing per-row-band weights is crucial for nuanced control.
   3. Boss Edge Validation (Phase 4): Ensure all R-1 Ports connect to the Boss, and only R-1 connects.
   4. Sophisticated Repair Policy (Phase 5): The current repair logic is basic and needs improvement for better convergence.
   5. Comprehensive Testing (Phase 7): Unit and integration tests are entirely missing but vital for system robustness.
   6. Telemetry & QA Hooks (Phase 6): Implementing detailed logging for re-roll rates and pity vectors will significantly aid debugging.

  Discrepancies:
   * MapValidator.AreCountsWithinLimits now only validates Boss count, aligning with "no global hard targets," but telemetry still expects per-type counts.
   * AreSpacingRulesRespected currently checks vertical spacing between any two nodes of the same type, stricter than the "along any path" rule. This needs clarification or a more complex path-tracing implementation.

  In conclusion, the system is structurally sound, but the re-roll validation and more advanced repair logic are critical next steps to achieve stable, rule-compliant map generation. Comprehensive testing is also paramount.
