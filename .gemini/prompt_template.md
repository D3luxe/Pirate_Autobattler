Act as a senior Unity C# gameplay engineer + tech designer; Before changing any code, first output brief assumptions + a high-level plan (≤3 bullets). Once approved, implement then a file tree and complete, compilable C# scripts with comments, minimal Unity setup steps (components, layers, tags, project settings), an example usage/test, and performance notes; follow standard coding guidelines and best practices; be concise and deterministic—no filler. Ask questions if any of the intended functionality is unclear. Follow [FILE HERE];

-- Left off dealing with regression in mapgenerator after file corruption and gemini complications.
Restored mapgenerator.cs to version with infinite loop that was diagnosed by gpt with the cause determined to be:

When backtracking selects a new alternative at a prior step, the code does not re-add the edge for that step and does not update currentCol to the newly chosen next column. It also resets r = lastStep.Row inside a for loop (which then increments), effectively leaving you at the same problematic row without any state change. This yields a loop that repeatedly hits the pre-boss row and backtracks again.
