### Overall Assessment

Your UI system has a strong architectural foundation based on modern, effective patterns like Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM), a centralized `UIManager`, and Service/Event-driven logic. The "spiderweb" feeling you've encountered is a common and solvable issue that arises as systems grow in complexity. The following refactoring suggestions aim to strengthen the boundaries between your components, enforce clearer communication patterns, and reduce coupling, making the system more robust and maintainable for the future.

---

### 1. Refine the UIManager's Role from Creator to Coordinator

> **Observation:** The `UIManager` acts as a "central hub" responsible for both instantiating (`creating`) and managing (`coordinating`) all major UI controllers (`PlayerPanelController`, `ShopController`, etc.).

> **Analysis:** This gives the `UIManager` too many responsibilities, turning it into a "god object." It creates tight coupling, as the `UIManager` must have direct knowledge of every controller it manages. This makes the system rigid; adding a new UI panel requires modifying the `UIManager` itself.

#### Refactoring Suggestion:
1.  **Adopt a Service Locator or Dependency Injection (DI) pattern.**
2.  Create a "bootstrapper" or "installer" script that runs at game startup. Its sole job is to create one instance of each core service and UI controller.
3.  This bootstrapper registers all these instances with a central, static `ServiceLocator`.
4.  Modify the `UIManager` to retrieve its dependencies from the `ServiceLocator` instead of creating them. Its role shifts from *creating* controllers to *coordinating* already-existing ones.

**Benefit:**
*   The `UIManager` is now decoupled from the concrete controller classes. This makes the system highly modular—you can add or replace UI panels without ever touching the `UIManager`'s code, which also greatly simplifies unit testing.

### 2. Formalize the User Interaction Flow with the Command Pattern

> **Observation:** The `SlotManipulator` component directly communicates with multiple services (`ItemManipulationService`, `UIInteractionService`) to handle user actions.

> **Analysis:** This makes the view component (`SlotManipulator`) too "smart." It needs to know which services to call and in what order, and it's involved in business logic and validation (like checking `IsInCombat`). This improperly mixes input handling with application logic.

#### Refactoring Suggestion:
1.  **Implement the Command Pattern.** When a user performs an action (e.g., drops an item), the `SlotManipulator` should create a command object that encapsulates the request (e.g., `new MoveItemCommand(sourceSlot, targetSlot)`).
2.  This command object is then sent to a single, central `UICommandProcessor` service.
3.  The `UICommandProcessor` handles the entire lifecycle:
    *   It first asks the command if it's valid by calling a method like `command.CanExecute()`.
    *   The `CanExecute()` method on the command object contains the validation logic, querying the `UIInteractionService` internally.
    *   If valid, the processor calls `command.Execute()`, which in turn calls the appropriate logic service (e.g., `ItemManipulationService`).

**Benefit:**
*   Your view components become simple, reusable input handlers. All interaction logic and validation rules are centralized and encapsulated within command objects, making them easy to manage, debug, and extend.

### 3. Decouple Controllers from the Tooltip System

> **Observation:** Multiple controllers (`ShopController`, `RewardUIController`) individually use a `TooltipUtility` to register callbacks and manage tooltips.

> **Analysis:** This creates redundancy and a direct dependency from feature controllers to the tooltip's implementation. If you wanted to change how tooltips work, you would have to modify every controller that uses them.

#### Refactoring Suggestion:
1.  **Create a fully event-driven tooltip system.**
2.  Instead of calling a utility, any component that wants to show a tooltip should dispatch a global event, like `TooltipShowRequestedEvent`, containing the necessary data (item ID, screen position, etc.).
3.  Create a single, dedicated `TooltipManager` service that subscribes to `TooltipShowRequestedEvent` and `TooltipHideRequestedEvent`.
4.  This `TooltipManager` is the only component that should know about the `TooltipController` and `EffectDisplay`. It listens for events and orchestrates the showing and hiding of tooltips.

**Benefit:**
*   Your feature controllers no longer know or care *how* tooltips are displayed. They only need to announce their intent. This completely decouples game features from the UI implementation, allowing you to change the entire tooltip system by only modifying the `TooltipManager`.

---

### 4. Enforce a Strict, Unidirectional Data Flow for the ViewModel

> **Observation:** The `PlayerPanelDataViewModel` is correctly identified as the "single source of truth for the view." It gets its state from both direct calls to the `GameSession` and by listening to the `EventBus`.

> **Analysis:** While functional, having multiple triggers for state updates can create subtle bugs or race conditions. A more predictable pattern is to have a single, clear trigger for all state changes.

#### Refactoring Suggestion:
1.  **Establish the `EventBus` as the sole trigger for ViewModel updates.** The ViewModel should not actively pull data or have its state pushed from arbitrary places.
2.  When a game action occurs, the relevant service (e.g., `ItemManipulationService`) performs its logic and then broadcasts a specific event (e.g., `PlayerInventoryUpdatedEvent`).
3.  The `PlayerPanelDataViewModel` subscribes to this event. Its event handler is the *only* place where it should update its state. Inside the handler, it can then pull the fresh, authoritative data from the `GameSession`.

**Benefit:**
*   This creates a predictable, unidirectional data flow: **Action → Service Logic → Event → ViewModel Updates → View Automatically Reflects Change**. This pattern is far easier to debug because you know that the ViewModel's state can only ever change in response to a specific event, eliminating an entire class of potential UI synchronization bugs.
